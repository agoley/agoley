By design it promises to be a great daily runner, meant to go easy on your knees for long runs on hard surfaces.</p><p>After seeing the marketing for the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit, I was hooked by the ample ZoomX cushioning and was anticipating giving them a try as my pegasus turbo 2 where starting to reach their end of life. I ordered from the Nike app on March 15th, and received them a week later on March 22nd.</p><p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Responsiveness</b></p><p>Just from looking at these you might have high expectations for the responsiveness. The shoe sits on a luxuriant ZoomX midsole measuring (2 in) tall by (4.25 in) wide at the mid heel and (1.5 in) tall by (5.5 in) wide at the forefoot. Before hitting the pavement, I could tell these are different just from trying them on. The initial feeling is a forward leaning bounce. Some other shoes have a bounce to them but from my experience these are in a class of their own. I tried them on in a gym out of curiosity, and they add an extra (3 - 5 in) to my vertical compared to my usual Jordan 14's (Zoom unit forefoot). After taking them to the pavement I can confirm that the responsiveness is great and the feeling persists for the entire run. </p></div><div class="media-frame"><div><span>Media Player</span></div><video width="800" controls="" autoplay="" loop=""><source src="assets/video/IMG_1288.MOV" "="" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div style="max-width: 800px;"><p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Stability</b></p><p>My initial impression after walking was that stability would be a problem. There is so much responsiveness that it feels like I could easily roll an ankle. I would warn that if you intend on walking a lot in them, they might not be the best option. However once you get moving, my concerns about stability were left behind. At a jog they become much more stable. Also as I broke them in they became more stable.</p><p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Comfort</b></p><p>If you have ever worn a Flynit shoe, you know that the upper is very soft and breathable. With added padding around the ankle I haven’t experienced any chafing. Under foot these are extremely soft, and your foot will sink into the foam just slightly.</p><p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Traction</b></p><p>Traction is fine. Down steep hills, and around tight corners in the rain I haven’t experienced any slipping. Also the traction feels like new at the ~50 mi mark.</p><p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Speed</b></p><p>They’re surprisingly light with all the foam and added padding in the upper. Combine the responsiveness with a decent drop (0.5 in) from heel to toe these will propel you forward. There is no plate in the sole, just 100% foam. These aren’t designed for speed but for a max comfort shoe they won’t hurt your pace much if you decided to pick it up.</p></div><div class="media-frame"><div><span>Media Player</span></div><video width="800" controls="" autoplay="" loop=""><source src="assets/video/IMG_1287.MOV" "="" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div style="max-width: 800px;"><p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Style</b></p><p>These aren’t the type of runners that can double as streetwear. However, for a daily runner I think they look fine. There are three color ways at the time of writing this, I like the white/racer blue.</p><p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Verdict</b></p><p>🏃&zwj;♂️🏃&zwj;♂️🏃&zwj;♂️🏃&zwj;♂️ (4/5) Strides<br><br> There's not much to dislike about the Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit. I deducted a stride for stability and style, but these deliver what I want from an every day running shoe. </p></div><p class="ask-alex">Thanks for reading.
